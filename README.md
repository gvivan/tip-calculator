# tip-calculator
A simple application to help me calculate tips each time I go to a restaurant.

If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6 
Then, format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

# Example Input

```
150.00
12%
5
```

# Example Output

```
Each person should pay: $33.60 
```
